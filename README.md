# Birthday-Problem

Hello All, 

This is just a fun project I did when I was bored last summer. I was trying to prove a closed form solution to the famous birthday problem 
that didn't rely on the classic "guess-and-check" iterative method. I used simulation statistics to ultimately prove that while my method 
was a close approximation at small room values, it underestimated the probabilities of large rooms. 

Still in Progress: I still want to check computation times to see if there is any advangtage to the method I came up with.
